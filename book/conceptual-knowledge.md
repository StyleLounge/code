# Conceptual Knowledge

This is a collection of talks that are insightful and inspiring to every developer. Of course the selection is highly opinionated but the goal is to have only the creme de la creme of technical talks. And the focus is not on specific tools or languages, but on getting a deeper understanding of concepts underlying everyday's development.

⚠️ There's millions of talks about computer science and software engineering out there. Please open a pull request if you think something should be removed or added. Thank you!

### Rich Hickey – The Value of Values

> Mind-opening talk about very common conceptions about entities and how to story information. A great motivator for immutability and definitely a must see.

### Ryan Dahl - The idea behind node.js: Callback-based asynchronicity & the event loop

> As relevant to node.js developers as to everybody else. Ryan explains the motivation behind the asynchronicity model of node.js and explains the conceptual problems with traditional thread-based models.

> By the way: Uwe gave many great talks, one gem if you want to deep-dive into consistency is “[Real-world consistency explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG3xKyldSK0)”

### Adrian Cockroft – Migrating to Microservices

> Definitely on of the better “migrating to microservices” talks. It gives a great overview and - most importantly - explains the reasoning behind architectural decisions.
