### Adrian Cockroft – Migrating to Microservices

> Definitely on of the better “migrating to microservices” talks. It gives a great overview and - most importantly - explains the reasoning behind architectural decisions.

### [12 factors of a 12 factor application](http://12factor.net/)

> Even less to say about this. Just makes a lot of sense

### [Post from Gene Hughson on microservices boundaries governance, reuse and complexity](https://genehughson.wordpress.com/2014/06/04/more-on-microservices-boundaries-governance-reuse-complexity/)

> Great post that contains lots of links

### [Turning the database inside out with Apache Samza](https://www.confluent.io/blog/turning-the-database-inside-out-with-apache-samza/)

> Although this post is about Apache Samza, a stream processing framework, this article is a seriously great deep dive into databases and distributed non ACID-systems.
