# Talks

This is a collection of talks that are insightful and inspiring to every developer. Of course the selection is highly opinionated but the goal is to have only the creme de la creme of technical talks. And the focus is not on specific tools or languages, but on getting a deeper understanding of concepts underlying everyday's development.

⚠️ There's millions of talks about computer science and software engineering out there. Please open a pull request if you think something should be removed or added. Thank you!

### Rich Hickey – The Value of Values

> Mind-opening talk about very common conceptions about entities and how to story information. A great motivator for immutability and definitely a must see.
