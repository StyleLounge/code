# Testing

### **Simple Testing Can Prevent Most Critical Failures**

> **... for the most catastrophic failures, almost all of them are caused by incorrect error handling, and 58% of them are trivial mistakes or can be exposed by statement coverage testing.**

### Don't use **Mocha's **`this`** context**

> Why? Easier to understand and maintain, especially with more complex tests

```javascript
// bad
describe("createSlackAlertEmitter", function() {
    this.mockA;
    it("should create a new notifier", function() {
        test(this.mockA);
    });
});

// good
describe("createSlackAlertEmitter", function() {
    const mockA;
    it("should create a new notifier", function() {
        test(mockA);
    });
});
```

### Don't mock what you don't own

> It decouples the production code from code that we don't have control over,  
> so when the library changes no test fails although the code does not work anymore.

```javascript
// bad
it("should call amqplib.publish", function(done) {
    const channel = stub();
    channel.publish = stub().callsSecondArgWith(null);

    const connection = stub();
    connection.channel = stub().callsFirstArgWith(null, channel);

    const amqplib = stub();
    amqplib.connect = stub().callsFirstArgWith(null, connection);

    // ... do stuff with amqplib
});
```

> #### Good
>
> 1. Create an adapter for the library and thoroughly test the adapter against an actual RabbitMq instance.
> 2. If you're positive that the adapter works correctly, you own it.
> 3. You can know happily mock it in other tests

### Don't monkey patch

> ðŸš§ This section is a stub. Please help by expanding it!
>
> If it is necessary to replace just a part of the SUT to properly test,  
> then the design is not very good and should be improved instead of working around obvious limitations.

### Don't reuse

> ðŸš§ This section is a stub. Please help by expanding it!
>
> reusing stuff creates side effects that could make tests non deterministic and therefore not very helpful.  
> When testing against a database it can make sense for performance reasons to reuse DB connections.  
> Be careful though to reset database contents.

### Watch every test fail at least once

> ðŸš§ This section is a stub. Please help by expanding it!
>
> The main goal of tests is to alert if something does not work anymore,  
> so we should make sure that a test is able to fail and fail for a specific reason to make that test meaningful.

### Don't test code, test requirements

> ðŸš§ This section is a stub. Please help by expanding it!
>
> If you have to change the test when changing the implementation, it is not very helpful  
> to make sure the stuff we forgot about still works.

### If writing tests is not easy and obvious the code needs improvement
