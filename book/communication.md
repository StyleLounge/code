# Team Communication

### **Always Respond \(briefly\) on Slack**

> Why? Because any feedback is appreciated and better than no feedback at all, even if you don't have the answer
>
> #### Bad
>
> If it's not obvious for the asking person that you're not concerned, not answering always keeps them in limbo.
>
> #### Good
>
> Use 😶 \(`:no_mouth:`\) to show that you've read but are currently not planning on responding.  
> This takes the asker out of limbo.
>
> #### Even Better
>
> * Use ✅ \(`:white_check_mark:`\) to agree or ❌ \(`:x:`\) to disagree
> * Use ⌛️ \(`:hourglass:`\) to show that you will respond at a later point in time

### Use avatar emoji to indicate agreement

> Why? It saves a lot of time and is way easier to read than scanning through messages by multiple people
>
> #### Example for decision making

### Use avatar emoji for important announcements

> Why? Distributing small pieces of important information can take a lot of time and is no fun.

> #### Example for a dedicated `#dev-announcements` channel
