# Directory and Path difference

### **Always use a path**

* Directory - place where file is located
* Path - string that shows the location of the file

### Use path when you want to save a location of file/files in string

```typescript
  // bad
  const dir = './validations/productValidation';
  // good
  const path = './validations/productValidation';
```
