# Welcome!

The goal of this little GitBook is to make you and me a better software developer. It tries to do this by sharing experience and knowledge in the form of patterns and by encouraging you to [contribute](/contribute.md) so that others can learn from you. üññüèæ

#### Why Patterns?

Patterns are small reusable structures that allow

* A focused discussion of
  * Applicability
  * Expected impact
* Forking and Sharing
* Efficient speech by replacing concepts with terms

## Perspective

This book is maintained by StyleLounge and therefore starts from their point of view: A reactive \([reactivemanifesto.org](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org)\), fully decoupled microservice architecture running on node.js/TypeScript, properly tested and continuously and continuously deployed into a kubernetes cluster \([read more about our technology](http://www.stylelounge.io/technology/)\).

Our stated goal is to provide knowledge that is as applicable in other contexts.
