# Communication

### **Always provide some feedback on Slack**

> Why? Because any feedback is appreciated and better than no feedback at all, even if you don't have the answer

// bad
Not replying at all to a question or to a message that may concern you according to the person asking
(e.g. if the question is in `#dev-only` and you're a developer)

// good
Replying to a question in the best possible way you can:
* by default (if there is no better solution) use `:tumbleweed:` as a reaction to indicate you saw the message
* by using the `:white_check_mark:` or `:x:` emoji as a reaction to the message, especially if the message has the `:question:` emoji at the beginning, so that the person who asked the question knows if (s)he should wait a bit longer or if (s)he should look for an alternative solution right away
* by giving an estimation of the time needed before you'll be able to give a proper reply if you can be helpful but you're currently busy for a long time, as it enables the person waiting for you to plan something/ask somebody else
* by responding to polls
* by using your personal emoji as a reaction under the message when it makes sense, especially if this is the `#dev-announcements` channel
